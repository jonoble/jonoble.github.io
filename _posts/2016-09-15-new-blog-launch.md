It's been a little while since I scrapped my old personal blog at jonoble.com because I never got round to posting. Now that I'm in the habit of using Git and want to contribute to projects on GitHub, I thought that I would stand a chance of posting more often by launching a blog on GitHub Pages using [Jekyll](http://rekyllrd.com).

Credit where it's due; I got this up and running using [this excellent tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by Jonathan McGlone.
